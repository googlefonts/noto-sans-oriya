# Noto fonts

Noto’s goal is to provide a beautiful reading experience for all languages. It is a free, professionally-designed, open-source collection of fonts with a harmonious look and feel in multiple weights and styles. All Noto fonts are published under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL) v1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), which allows you to copy, modify, and redistribute them if you need to.

To easily preview and download Noto fonts, visit http://www.google.com/get/noto. For background, technical details, and how to contribute, see the [FAQ](FAQ.md), [CONTRIBUTING-fonts](CONTRIBUTING-fonts.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Intended Content of the Directories contained here:
* design : is intended to hold all design artifacts, images, sketches, etc.
* hinted : should contain all hinted fonts created from the source in src directory.
* src : Glyphs.app source (until we figure how how to also support UFOs)
* test : test files to test the fonts (most likely html)
* unhinted : should contain all unhinted fonts created from the source in src directory.

Have fun with Noto! — Google Noto Team
